# Threat Intelligence Integration  

## Introduction  
Threat intelligence integration enhances the capabilities of a Security Operations Center (SOC) by combining indicators of compromise (IOCs), tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and threat feeds with existing security monitoring. By embedding threat intelligence into SIEM workflows and threat hunting processes, analysts can proactively detect malicious activity, enrich alerts with context, and respond effectively to evolving threats.

## Core Concepts  

### 1. Threat Intelligence Types  
Threat intelligence can be categorized into different forms, each serving a specific purpose in detection and response.  

| Type                                       | Example                                                        | Usage                                    |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)            | Malicious IPs, file hashes, domains                            | Detect known malicious activity          |
| Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) | MITRE ATT&CK T1078 (Valid Accounts), T1059 (Command Execution) | Understand attacker behavior beyond IOCs |
| Threat Feeds                               | STIX/TAXII-based feeds, AlienVault OTX                         | Automate IOC ingestion and correlation   |

### 2. Integration in SOC  
SOC teams integrate threat intelligence into SIEM systems (e.g., Splunk, ELK, Wazuh) to enrich and correlate alerts.  

**Example:**  
- A suspicious outbound connection detected in firewall logs is matched with a threat feed containing known Command & Control (C2) servers.  
- The SIEM enriches the alert with context (IP reputation, malware family, associated campaigns) to aid in triage.  

| Integration Component   | Example                             | Benefit                              |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| IOC Matching            | Firewall logs vs. malicious IP list | Immediate detection of known threats |
| Threat Feed Correlation | STIX/TAXII feeds                    | Automated enrichment of alerts       |
| Playbooks               | SOAR tools (e.g., TheHive + Cortex) | Faster, automated response           |

### 3. Threat Hunting with Intelligence  
Threat intelligence is not limited to detection; it also drives proactive threat hunting. Analysts can map threats against MITRE ATT&CK techniques and search logs for suspicious behavior.  

**Example:**  
- Hunting for **MITRE ATT&CK T1078 â€“ Valid Accounts misuse** by querying authentication logs for unusual successful logins from unexpected locations.  

| Threat Hunting Use Case  | Example IOC/TTP                 | Hunting Method                          |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Account compromise       | T1078 (Valid Accounts)          | Query authentication logs for anomalies |
| Lateral movement         | T1021 (Remote Services)         | Search for abnormal SMB/RDP activity    |
| Persistence techniques   | T1547 (Boot or Logon Autostart) | Hunt for unusual registry modifications |

## Key Objectives  
By learning and applying threat intelligence integration:  
- Understand and apply different types of threat intelligence (IOCs, TTPs, feeds).  
- Integrate intelligence into SIEM workflows for automated enrichment.  
- Use MITRE ATT&CK mappings to drive threat hunting activities.  
- Enhance detection and response capabilities in a SOC environment.
