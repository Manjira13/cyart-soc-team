# Incident Escalation Workflows  

## Introduction  
Incident escalation workflows define how security incidents are triaged, investigated, and resolved within a Security Operations Center (SOC). A well-defined escalation process ensures that alerts are handled efficiently, communication flows smoothly, and severe threats receive the right level of attention. Effective escalation reduces response time, avoids missed incidents, and improves collaboration across security and business stakeholders.

## Core Concepts  

### 1. Escalation Tiers  
SOC teams are generally structured into tiers, with each tier responsible for increasing levels of analysis and response.  

| SOC Tier                                  | Role/Responsibility                                                    | Example Task                                 |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Tier 1 – Triage                           | Initial alert review, filter false positives, escalate critical alerts | Identifying failed brute-force attempts      |
| Tier 2 – Investigation                    | Deep-dive into alerts, correlate logs, determine scope of attack       | Analyzing lateral movement after compromise  |
| Tier 3 – Advanced Analysis/Threat Hunting | Handle complex incidents, malware reverse engineering, threat hunting  | Investigating APT activity or custom malware |

**Escalation Criteria** may include:  
- Severity (e.g., ransomware outbreak vs. minor policy violation).  
- Complexity (requires advanced forensics or reverse engineering).  
- Impact (affects critical business systems or sensitive data).

### 2. Communication Protocols  
Clear communication is essential when escalating incidents. Structured reports ensure stakeholders receive accurate and actionable updates.  

**Examples:**  
- SITREP (Situation Report): A concise summary of incident status, scope, and next steps.  
- Stakeholder Briefings: High-level overviews for management and business leaders.  

| Communication Type   | Audience                 | Contents                                                     |
|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| SITREP (Technical)   | SOC Team, IR Analysts    | Incident summary, current status, timeline, mitigation steps |
| Executive Briefing   | CISO, Management         | Business impact, risk level, recommended actions             |
| Post-Incident Report | Stakeholders, Compliance | Root cause, lessons learned, corrective measures             |

### 3. Automation in Escalation  
Automation through SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) tools streamlines escalation by reducing manual workload.  

**Examples of automation:**
- Ticket assignment: Automatically assign alerts to the right tier.  
- Alert enrichment: Add contextual data (IP reputation, geolocation, MITRE ATT&CK mapping).  
- Playbooks: Predefined workflows for phishing, ransomware, or insider threats.  

| SOAR Function      | Example                                      | Benefit                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Ticket Automation  | Auto-assign phishing alert to Tier 1 analyst | Reduces manual task load       |
| Alert Enrichment   | Add threat intel data to suspicious IP       | Provides faster triage context |
| Automated Playbook | Trigger malware containment workflow         | Speeds up response             |

## Key Objectives  
By mastering incident escalation workflows:  
- Understand SOC tier structures and when to escalate incidents.  
- Communicate effectively using structured reports (SITREPs, executive briefings).  
- Leverage SOAR automation to streamline ticketing, alert enrichment, and response playbooks.  
- Reduce response time and improve coordination during incidents.
