# Advanced Log Analysis  

## Introduction  
Advanced log analysis is a critical skill in cybersecurity for detecting, investigating, and responding to security incidents. It goes beyond simple log monitoring by correlating events across multiple data sources, detecting anomalies, and enriching logs with additional context. These techniques help uncover sophisticated attack patterns and reduce false positives in a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment.

## Core Concepts  

### 1. Log Correlation  
Log correlation involves linking related events from different log sources to build a complete picture of an attack.  

**Example:**  
- Failed login attempts (`Event ID 4625` in Windows Security Logs) followed by suspicious outbound traffic (from firewall logs) may indicate a brute-force attack followed by successful exfiltration.  

| Source Log           | Event/Indicator                | Significance                                |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Windows Security Log | Event ID 4625 (Failed Login)   | Possible brute-force or credential stuffing |
| Firewall Log         | Outbound traffic to unknown IP | Data exfiltration attempt                   |
| Application Log      | Access from unusual IP         | Account compromise attempt                  |

### 2. Anomaly Detection  
Anomaly detection identifies deviations from baseline behavior using **statistical models** or **rule-based methods**.  

**Examples of anomalies to detect:**  
- Unusual login times (e.g., midnight logins for a 9–5 employee).  
- High-volume data transfers compared to baseline traffic.  
- Multiple logins from geographically distant locations within a short time frame.  

| Anomaly Type       | Example Scenario                         | Detection Method                              |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Time-based anomaly | Login at 3:00 AM                         | Rule-based threshold                          |
| Volume anomaly     | Sudden 10GB data upload                  | Statistical deviation                         |
| Geo-anomaly        | Login from US and India within 5 minutes | IP geolocation + correlation                  |

### 3. Log Enrichment  
Log enrichment adds **contextual information** to raw logs, making them more useful for analysis.  

**Examples:**  
- Adding geolocation to IP addresses to detect impossible travel.  
- Mapping user roles from an HR database to detect privilege misuse.  
- Using threat intelligence feeds to identify connections to known malicious domains.  

| Raw Log                                 | Enriched Context                       | Benefit                                  |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 192.168.1.10 accessed 203.0.113.5       | IP geolocation: `203.0.113.5 → Russia` | Identifies unusual international traffic |
| User: JohnD accessed sensitive folder   | User role: `Intern`                    | Detects privilege abuse                  |
| Outbound DNS query: xyz-domain.com      | Threat intel: `Known C2 server`        | Faster threat detection                  |
