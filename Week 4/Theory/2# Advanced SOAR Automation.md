# Advanced SOAR Automation  

## Introduction  
**Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)** platforms empower SOC teams by streamlining repetitive tasks, integrating security tools, and enabling automated incident response. By leveraging orchestration workflows, automation scripts, and response playbooks, SOC analysts can reduce Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Respond (MTTR), while focusing on complex investigations rather than routine triage.

## Core Concepts  

### 1. SOAR Components  
SOAR platforms combine three core functionalities:  

| Component         | Description                                                    | Example                                                    |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Orchestration     | Integration of multiple security tools into a unified workflow | Linking SIEM alerts with EDR and firewall responses        |
| Automation        | Execution of predefined tasks without human intervention       | Auto-ticket creation, IOC enrichment via VirusTotal        |
| Response          | Actionable steps taken to mitigate threats                     | Auto-blocking malicious IPs or isolating compromised hosts |

### 2. Playbook Development  
Playbooks define **step-by-step automated workflows** for handling specific incident types.  

**Example – Phishing Response Playbook:**  
1. Receive suspicious email alert from SIEM.  
2. Extract sender IP, URL, and attachments.  
3. Enrich with threat intelligence (e.g., VirusTotal, OTX).  
4. If malicious: block sender domain, quarantine email, and notify user.  
5. Generate incident report and close ticket.  

| Incident Type     | Playbook Workflow                                         | Automated Actions                           |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Phishing          | Email analysis → IOC enrichment → Quarantine → User alert | Auto-quarantine email, notify affected user |
| Malware Infection | Endpoint alert → Hash lookup → Contain system             | Auto-isolate infected endpoint              |
| C2 Communication  | SIEM detects C2 traffic → Enrich with TI feed → Block IP  | Auto-block IP on firewall                   |

### 3. Integration with SIEM/EDR  
SOAR platforms integrate seamlessly with SIEMs (e.g., Wazuh, Elastic) and EDR tools to create closed-loop workflows.  

**Example Workflow:**  
- SIEM detects suspicious outbound traffic.  
- SOAR enriches IP with threat intelligence.  
- If confirmed malicious, SOAR instructs firewall to block IP and EDR to isolate endpoint.  
- A ticket is generated automatically with a SITREP for escalation.  

| Tool                                      | SOAR Integration Role                            |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Wazuh/Elastic SIEM                        | Alert ingestion, correlation, enrichment trigger |
| EDR (CrowdStrike, OSQuery, etc.)          | Endpoint visibility, containment actions         |
| Ticketing (TheHive, JIRA, ServiceNow)     | Auto-incident creation and case tracking         |
| Threat Intelligence (OTX, VirusTotal)     | Enrichment for IOCs                              |

## Key Objectives  
By mastering advanced SOAR automation, you will be able to:  
- Understand the **orchestration, automation, and response** components of SOAR.  
- Design and implement **incident playbooks** for common threats.  
- Integrate SOAR with **SIEMs, EDRs, and ticketing tools** for full automation.  
- Reduce SOC fatigue by eliminating repetitive tasks and accelerating response times.
