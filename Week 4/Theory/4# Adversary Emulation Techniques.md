# Adversary Emulation Techniques  

## Introduction  
Adversary emulation is the practice of **simulating real-world attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)** in a controlled environment to test and improve an organization’s security posture. Unlike generic penetration testing, adversary emulation is aligned with **MITRE ATT&CK techniques** and specific threat actor behaviors, making it highly relevant for **SOC detection, response validation, and Red-Blue team exercises**.

## Core Concepts  

### 1. Adversary Emulation  
Adversary emulation focuses on replicating attacker behaviors to validate detection and response mechanisms.  

**Examples of ATT&CK Techniques to Emulate:**  
- T1566 – Phishing: Delivering malicious email attachments to test email filters and user awareness.  
- T1210 – Exploitation of Remote Services: Testing SOC visibility when remote services like SMB or RDP are targeted.  

| Technique ID | Name                            | Emulation Example                  | SOC Value                         |
|--------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| T1566        | Phishing                        | Send simulated spearphishing email | Tests email filtering + awareness |
| T1210        | Exploitation of Remote Services | Attempt SMB brute force in lab     | Tests intrusion detection         |
| T1059        | Command & Scripting Interpreter | Run PowerShell payload             | Validates endpoint monitoring     |

### 2. Emulation Frameworks  
Frameworks and tools streamline adversary simulation by mapping actions to MITRE ATT&CK.  

**Example – MITRE Caldera:**  
- Open-source automated adversary emulation platform.  
- Uses “agents” to execute attacker-like behaviors.  
- Provides repeatable and measurable emulation campaigns.  

| Framework/Tool            | Description                                        | Use Case                               |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| MITRE Caldera             | Automated adversary simulation aligned with ATT&CK | Run campaigns for APT28-style attacks  |
| Atomic Red Team           | Small tests mapped to ATT&CK techniques            | Validate single detection rules        |
| Red Team Automation (RTA) | Python scripts simulating adversary actions        | Lightweight simulation for SOC testing |

### 3. Red-Blue Team Collaboration  
Adversary emulation is most effective in **Purple Team exercises**, where Red Teams simulate attacker behaviors and Blue Teams attempt detection and response.  

**Benefits:**  
- Validates SIEM detection rules (e.g., ELK, Wazuh).  
- Helps analysts tune alerts to reduce false positives.  
- Encourages shared understanding of attacker techniques.  

| Role        | Contribution      | Example                                   |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Red Team    | Simulate TTPs     | Launch phishing emulation                 |
| Blue Team   | Detect & respond  | Investigate alerts in SIEM                |
| Purple Team | Knowledge sharing | Adjust detection logic, improve playbooks |
