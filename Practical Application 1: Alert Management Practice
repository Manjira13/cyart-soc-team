1. Alert Management Practice
Activities:
Tools: Google Sheets, Wazuh, TheHive.
Tasks: Create an alert classification system, prioritize alerts, document response procedures, create incident tickets, and practice escalation.
Enhanced Tasks:
Alert Classification System: Create a Google Sheets table to map alerts to MITRE ATT&CK techniques:
| Alert ID | Type        | Priority | MITRE Tactic       |
|----------|-------------|----------|--------------------|
| 001      | Phishing    | High     | T1566             |
Test with a mock alert (e.g., “Phishing Email: Suspicious Link”).
Prioritize Alerts: Simulate alerts (e.g., “Critical: Log4Shell Exploit Detected” vs. “Low: Port Scan”) and score using CVSS in Google Sheets. Example: Log4Shell CVSS 9.8 = Critical.
Dashboard Creation: In Wazuh, create a dashboard to visualize alert priorities (e.g., pie chart for Critical vs. High alerts).
Incident Ticket: Draft a ticket in TheHive with fields:
Title: [Critical] Ransomware Detected on Server-X
Description: Indicators: [File: crypto_locker.exe], [IP: 192.168.1.50]
Priority: Critical
Assignee: SOC Analyst
Escalation Role-Play: Draft a 100-word email to escalate a Critical alert to Tier 2, summarizing the incident and IOCs.
